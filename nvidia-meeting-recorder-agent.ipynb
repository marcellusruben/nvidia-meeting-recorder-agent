    "In this notebook, we'll build a meeting recorder agent capable of finding appointments on your Google Calendar, recording the meetings, and sending the recording assets — including video, transcription, and summary — via email.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the notebook, you'll have an agent that can perform several key tasks, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checking your meeting schedule on Google Calendar and retrieving relevant meeting information  \n",
    "- Creating a meeting recorder to capture the session and monitoring its real-time status  \n",
    "- Sending the recording, transcription, and summary of the meeting to a specified email address\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we’ll explore how to persist the agent’s memory using the xpander SDK, and observe the agent’s real-time thought process as it completes each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll be using the `xpander.ai` Python SDK and NVIDIA NIM to bring this agent to life. The xpander SDK manages the workflow and orchestration, while NVIDIA NIM powers the agent's large language model.\n",

    "Since we're going to use xpander and NVIDIA NIM, then we need to set up two different API keys before we start: xpander API key and NVIDIA NIM API key. Let's fetch our xpander.ai API key first.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"Fetch-xpander.ai-API-Key\"></a>\n",
    "## Fetch xpander.ai API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to fetch your `xpander.ai` API key is by using the xpander CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the CLI, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. If you haven’t installed Node.js yet, visit their [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and follow the installation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Node.js is installed, run the following command to install the xpander CLI globally:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install -g xpander-cli\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, log in to your xpander account via the CLI to retrieve your API key by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "xpander login\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your API key will be displayed in the terminal, as shown in the visualization below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img_1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy your xpander API key and paste it into the `.env` file you created after completing the steps in the **Getting Started** section of this repo.\n",

    "\n",
    "<a id=\"Fetch-NVIDIA-NIM-API-Key\"></a>\n",
    "## Fetch NVIDIA NIM API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get the NVIDIA NIM API key for free. Just head over to [https://build.nvidia.com/models](https://build.nvidia.com/models) and select the LLM you’d like to use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this blueprint, we’ll use NVIDIA’s `llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img_2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on **Get API Key** in the top-right corner, then copy your NVIDIA NIM API key and paste it into the `.env` file you created after completing the steps in the **Getting Started** section of this repo.\n",

    "After clicking the button, you'll be redirected to the xpander console, as shown in the visualization below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Img 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a template to build an AI agent is straightforward. The template handles everything needed to set up the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It configures the required interface(s), such as Google Calendar, along with the relevant operations (e.g., retrieve events, create events, delete events, etc.).\n",
    "- It orchestrates the agent’s logical workflow, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Img 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you click **Finish**, you’ll see that a new AI agent called **AI Meeting Recorder Agent (Imported)** has been successfully created in your xpander account.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Img 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking on the newly created agent will show you the agent's orchestration derived from the template, along with the configured interfaces needed to run the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a key feature of this agent is the ability to check your Google Calendar for scheduled meetings, you’ll need to grant xpander permission to access your calendar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven’t granted this permission yet, you’ll see a warning icon next to the Google Calendar operation, as shown in the visualization below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Img 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "To grant xpander permission to access our Google Calendar, click on the warning icon. Next, click **Sign In with Google Calendar** and then follow the prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you grant the permission to xpander, then the warning icon should dissapear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing we need to do is to bind the agent ID with our API key so that we can interact with the agent. Additionally, we also need to store the agent ID into the `.env` file. To do these things, click on **SDK** node at the top of the graph visualization of your xpander console, as you can see below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Img 7]\n",

    "## Interact and Execute Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In thi section,  we’ll execute and interact with the agent we created with the template. As mentioned in the introduction of this notebook, we’ll be using the agent to perform several tasks, such as:\n",

    "- Checking our meeting schedule on Google Calendar and retrieving relevant meeting information\n",

    "In this notebook, we've explored how to use the AI Meeting Recorder Agent for various meeting-related tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Google Calendar Integration**:\n",
    "   - Authorization and authentication\n",
    "   - Retrieving upcoming meetings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Meeting Recording Capabilities**:\n",
    "   - Setting up recording bots for meetings\n",
    "   - Checking recording status\n",
    "   - Processing completed recordings\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Email Notifications**:\n",
    "   - Sending meeting summaries via email\n",
    "   - Including action items and key points\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory and Context Preservation**:\n",
    "   - Using thread IDs to maintain conversation context\n",

    "In this blueprint, we've created a meeting recorder agent with the help of xpander.ai and NVIDIA NIM. You can now use this blueprint as a starting point to incorporate NVIDIA AI into xpander workflow, or apply it to different use cases that combine xpander and NVIDIA NIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also further enhance the use of our Meeting Recorder Agent, as examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customize the agent with additional tools or capabilities\n",
    "2. Integrate with other calendar systems or communication platforms\n",
    "3. Develop more sophisticated workflows for specific meeting types\n",
    "4. Implement authentication for multiple users\n",
    "\n",
