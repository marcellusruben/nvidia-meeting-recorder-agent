    "# NVIDIA Meeting Recorder Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a meeting recorder agent capable of finding appointments on your Google Calendar, recording the meetings, and sending the recording assets 8video, transcription, and summary) via email.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the notebook, you'll be able to build and run an agent with xpander that can perform several key tasks, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checking your meeting schedule on Google Calendar and retrieving relevant meeting information  \n",
    "- Creating a meeting recorder to capture the session and monitoring its real-time status  \n",
    "- Sending the recording, transcription, and summary of the meeting to a specified email address\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we’ll explore how to persist the agent’s memory using the xpander SDK, and observe the agent’s real-time thought process as it completes each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll be using the xpander Python SDK and NVIDIA NIM to bring this agent to life. The xpander SDK manages the workflow and orchestration, while NVIDIA NIM powers the agent's large language model.\n",

    "   - Sending meeting summaries via email\n",
    "   - Including action items and key points\n",

    "In this blueprint, we've created a meeting recorder agent with the help of xpander.ai and NVIDIA NIM. You can now use this blueprint as a starting point to incorporate NVIDIA AI into xpander workflow, or apply it to different use cases that combine xpander and NVIDIA NIM.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can also further enhance the use of our Meeting Recorder Agent, as examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customize the agent with additional tools or capabilities\n",
    "2. Integrate with other calendar systems or communication platforms\n",
    "3. Develop more sophisticated workflows for specific meeting types\n",
    "4. Implement authentication for multiple users\n",
