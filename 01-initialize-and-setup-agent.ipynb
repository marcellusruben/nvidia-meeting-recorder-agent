    "In this blueprint, we'll build a meeting recorder agent capable of finding appointments on your Google Calendar, recording the meetings, and sending the recordings via email.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll be using the xpander.ai Python SDK and NVIDIA NIM to bring this agent to life. The xpander SDK handles the overall workflow and orchestration, while NVIDIA NIM powers the agent's LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we'll need to set up a few prerequisites:\n",
    "- xpander API key\n",
